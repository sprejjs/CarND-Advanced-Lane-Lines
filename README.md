### Advanced Lane Finding project

In this project I have developed a pipeline to detect road lines using computer vision. The project is written in Python with the help of OpenCV.

The project code can be found in the [Jupyter notebook](code.ipynb) or the [Html Output](code.html) of the same notebook.

Some technical details and discussions for this project can be found in the [write up](writeup.md) file.

An example of the output can be found on YouTube:
