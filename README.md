### Advanced Lane Finding project

In this project I have developed a pipeline to detect road lines using computer vision. The project is written in Python with the help of OpenCV.

All of the details of the project, including the code and the example outputs can be found in the [Jupyter notebook](write_up.ipynb) or the [Html Output](write_up.html) of the same project.

An example of the output can be found on YouTube:
